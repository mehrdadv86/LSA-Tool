# LSA-Tool
The script gets a list of words from an excel sheet and will upload them to the following website: http://lsa.colorado.edu/cgi-bin/LSA-matrix.html, "This interface allows you to compare the similarity of multiple texts or terms within a particular LSA space. Each text is compared to all other texts." The results for each subject will be saved in individual CSV  files.
